# FullStack-go-project

This repository contains the backend for the FullStack-go-project (Paytm clone). The backend is implemented in Go and includes a Docker setup so you can run it either locally or in containers.

## Repository layout

- `backend/` — Go backend service
  - `main.go` — service entrypoint
  - `go.mod` — Go module file
  - `go.dockerfile` — Dockerfile for building the Go service
  - `compose.yaml` — Docker Compose file to run the service (and any related services)

## Requirements

- Go (>= 1.18 recommended)
- Docker & Docker Compose (if you want to run in containers)
- Git

## Quick start — Docker (recommended)

1. Open a terminal and change to the `backend` directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Start the service using Docker Compose (this will build the image if needed):

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml up --build
```

3. The compose file will start the backend and any dependencies defined there. Check the Compose output for the service port.

To run in detached mode, add `-d`:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml up --build -d
```

To stop and remove containers created by compose:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml down
```

## Quick start — Run locally with Go

1. From the repo root or directly inside `backend`:

```bash
cd backend
go run main.go
```

2. Or build a binary and run it:

```bash
cd backend
go build -o bin/server
./bin/server
```

Note: The server's listen port and other configuration are defined in `backend/main.go` (or read from environment variables if implemented). If you need to change ports or credentials, edit that file or set the appropriate environment variables before running.

## Environment & configuration

- I did not find an explicit `.env` file in the workspace. If the application expects environment variables (for DB credentials, ports, etc.), set them in your shell or extend the Compose file.
- Check `backend/main.go` for configuration keys, default port, and any required secrets.

## API

This README does not enumerate API endpoints because the exact routes are defined in `backend/main.go` (or its handlers). To document APIs, run the server locally and open the routes, or inspect the router code in `main.go` and any handlers.

If you want, I can add a short OpenAPI/Swagger spec or a simple endpoints list after scanning `main.go`.

## Tests

There are no tests added yet. If you want, I can scaffold a few unit tests for critical handlers and add a `go test ./...` step.

## Troubleshooting

- Docker build errors: ensure your Dockerfile path `go.dockerfile` is correct in `compose.yaml`. If the compose file refers to a different Dockerfile name, update it or adjust the compose command.
- Port conflicts: if the service fails to start because the port is in use, change the port in `main.go` or the Compose port mapping.
- Missing environment variables: check `main.go` for required env vars and provide them in the environment or a `.env` file referenced by Docker Compose.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Typical contribution workflow:

1. Create a feature branch.
2. Add code & tests.
3. Open a pull request describing the change.

If you want, I can add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` template and a few unit tests as a follow-up.

## License

This repository doesn't contain a license file yet. If you want an open license, consider adding `LICENSE` (for example, MIT).

## Notes & assumptions

- Assumption: Backend is a single Go service in `backend/` and the Compose file orchestrates it.
- Assumption: No DB credentials or external service credentials were visible in the provided files. If there are secrets, keep them out of source control and use env vars or secret management.

If you'd like, I can:
- Generate a brief endpoint list by scanning `backend/main.go`.
- Add a `.env.example` with common env var names.
- Add basic unit tests and a GitHub Actions workflow to run `go test`.

Tell me which of these you'd like next and I'll proceed.
